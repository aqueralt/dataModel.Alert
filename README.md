# dataModel.Alert
This entity models an Alert and could be used to send alerts related to traffic jam, accidents, weather conditions, high level of pollutants and so on. T he purpose of the model is to support the generation of notifications for a user or trigger other actions, based on such alerts.
An Alert is generated by a specific situation. The main features of an Alert is that it is not predictable and it is not a recurrent data. That means that an Alert could be an accident or a high level of pollutants measure, additionally it could a patient falling over or a car driving in the wrong direction on a highway.
Some examples of context data are type of Alert (traffic, weather, security, and pollution, etc.), severity, location and so on.
